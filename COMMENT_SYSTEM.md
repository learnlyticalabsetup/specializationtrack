# Real Comment Tracking System
## Cloud Specialization Track

### 📊 **How It Works Now**

The comment system has been upgraded to capture **real comments** from all assignment pages and automatically save them to CSV files that integrate with your review dashboard.

### 🔄 **Integrated Comment Flow**

1. **User adds comment** → Assignment page (Azure MCQ, AWS Practical, etc.)
2. **Comment gets saved** → Automatically to both localStorage AND CSV system
3. **Dashboard updates** → Real-time statistics refresh
4. **CSV files updated** → Ready for download and deployment

### 📁 **Files Updated**

✅ **Comment Manager** (`js/comment-manager.js`)
- Centralized comment collection system
- Automatic CSV generation
- Real-time dashboard updates

✅ **Azure MCQ Review** (`azure_mcq_review.html`)
- Integrated with CSV system
- Real comment saving to `azure_comments.csv`
- Enhanced download functionality

✅ **AWS Practical Assignments** (`aws_practical_assignments.html`)
- Connected to comment manager
- Comments save to `aws_comments.csv`

✅ **Review Dashboard** (`deployment/review_dashboard.html`)
- Real-time comment count updates
- Live statistics from actual CSV data
- Auto-refresh when comments added

### 🎯 **What Happens When Comments Are Added**

#### **Azure Comments** (MCQ/Practical/Capstone):
```
User Comment → Azure Page → Comment Manager → azure_comments.csv → Dashboard Update
```

#### **AWS Comments** (Practical/MCQ/Capstone):
```
User Comment → AWS Page → Comment Manager → aws_comments.csv → Dashboard Update
```

### 📊 **CSV File Structure**

Each comment gets saved with:
- **timestamp** - When comment was made
- **reviewer_id** - Unique reviewer identifier  
- **assignment_type** - mcq, practical, capstone
- **assignment_number** - Which assignment/question
- **section** - Specific section being reviewed
- **comment_type** - feedback, improvement, positive, etc.
- **rating** - 1-5 star rating
- **comment_text** - Actual comment content
- **action_required** - yes/no for follow-up needed
- **status** - pending, completed, etc.
